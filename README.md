# A Twitter-like web3 application

A project where I learned some Solidity, write + deploy a smart contract to the ETH blockchain, and build a Web3 client app to interact with my contract.

In this app you can connect your ETH wallet and send me a wave. With every wave you have a chance to win 0.0001 ETH, and if you send me a GIF with your wave, you increase your chances significantly. 

See [Live App](https://waveportal-starter-project.avocadohooman.repl.co/)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
